Version: 1.0.1
Date: 14. 08. 2021
  Bugfix:
    - Scripts now checks to make sure entities are valid, for those times when you place and delete entities in the same tick. (cough IR2 cough)
  Update:
    - Moved Classic Beacon files into the mod itself, and added blank sprites for the module visualization for when mods are looking for those. (cough editor extensions cough)
    - Fixed mk2 and mk3 shadows.
    - Removed Classic Beacon as a dependency (cuz, y'know, I integrated it)
    - Added some mods to the incompatibilities list that would likely cause issues if installed simultaneously.
